# The Horiseon SEO and Webpage Refactoring

## Description
This project involves a website from a marketing team. I wanted to help improve accessibility and search engine optimization for this website. I have made the code more readable by implementing semantic HTML elements so that any developer can see the layout of the page, added alt attributes, added a title element, and worked on the CSS so that it could be applied to more elements. This was a learning process that allowed me to get better knowledge of how classes can be utilized, how semantic HTML elements are utilized, and what would be considered standard for a website.
